The marketing team would like a donut chart (https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/piechart) that shows how each dollar donated to the organization is allocated.
  - 4 cents is for administrative costs
  - 16 cents is for fundraising
  - 36 cents funds youth programs
  - 44 cents funds adult program
The colors they would like are: #8AD1C2, #9F8AD1, #D18A99, #BCD18A.


The product team would like a visualization that shows students a timeline of how their studies in major area will progress. This will be for students who begin their studies in September of 2018.
  1. From Sept of 2018 to May of 2019, students will complete general education requirements.
  2. From June of 2019 to Aug of 2019, students will choose their major.
  3. From Sept of 2019 to May of 2020, students will complete two courses in their preferred area of study, one per semester.
  4. From Sept of 2020 to May of 2022, students will complete twelve courses in their preferred area of study, three per semester.
Build both a timeline visualization (https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/timeline) showing phases of study by date, as well as a bar chart (https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/barchart) showing how many classes in major area will be completed in each of the eight semesters (fall and spring, 2019 through 2022) of their study.

The colors used for the charts should be shades of blue.
